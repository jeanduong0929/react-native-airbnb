    "neighborhood_overview": "The House is Located in a quiet cul-de-sac. It's near a very peaceful road with no through traffic. Adjacent to Prestigious Royal Arsenal Riverside development. Woolwich is a district of South East London with a long and rich history.  A high amount of young professionals are residents in the area, among older people who have lived here for decades. Most of us work in the City-Bank, Canary Wharf, London Bridge, etc.  The things I love about where I live are: the museum at our door steps, the numerous heritage listed buildings in the neighbourhood, all complemented by several open parks, over 1km of river walks, and a rich history.  My advice to every guest is to always get off at the Woolwich Arsenal station and walk through the Royal Arsenal Development. If it\u2019s very late at night, you could always grab a bus or taxi from the station (3-4 minutes journey). A quick walk from home, you will find: *Greenwich Heritage Centre Museum *Royal Artillery (you will see them inside the public par",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

Another great development has been the market on Maltby Street which started with a few stalls and the excentric-in-a-good way vintage furniture shop Lassco and is now a very hype food market with excellent restaurants like St John's and the Spanish jamoneria Tozino. Definately worth a visit. The river enbankment is one of the most interesting parts of the whole river promenade. Just by walking along the street where the flat is you will",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The Canary Wharf area is traditionally known to be the beating heart of London\u2019s financial sector, full of tall buildings housing international banks. In recent years though, a large number of restaurants and bars have popped up in the area (and would be an easy 15-20 minute walk from the flat), such as Obica, Iberica, and Royal China. I particularly like Chai Ki, a modern Indian restaurant. You can also get drinks or have afternoon tea at the lovely Radisson Blu hotel nearby the apartment complex, which is a great setting to meet friends. Or, you can just use the kitchen in the apartment to cook yourself a meal and enjoy a nice comfy stay.

    "host_about": "My name is Fabio and I along with my friend and colleague Willian will ensure to provide you a wonderful stay in our apartments across London.\r\n\r\nWillian, Throughout his extensive travels, his unusual name \u2013 a derivative of William \u2013 has led to much curiosity. An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

Stretching some 750 meters along either side of a public cycle track and covering a total area of some 30,000 square meters, the park has three color-coded segments each semi-autonomous environments with their own programmatic and atmospheric agendas. The red square, painted bright red, orange and pink, focuses on recreation and modern living. \"The black market\" at the center just outside my front door is the park\u2019s square features a rolling landscape that is emblazoned with a mesh of white lines, which wind around set pieces like the Moroccan fountain, Chinese palm trees and a giant black octopus from Tokyo, Japan to be explored by children. The green park has rolling hills, trees and plants suitable for picnics, sports (chess, table tennis, basketball, skating, boxing, working out etc.) and walking the d",
    "notes": "The apartment is suitable for kids from the age of 6, but it is not possible to choose that age-range in the setup. The apartment is on 4th floor. There is a 32\" TV in the living room with no cable. But it has a Chromecast connected which means if you subscribe to Netflix, HBO etc. you can cast content from these streaming services to the TV via your phone/tablet/computer.  Tuesdays every other week - uneven weeks - there is municipal cleaning coming. The time differs but it is usually between 10am-2pm.",
    "transit": "The apartment is very close to N\u00f8rrebro Station where you can take the train or the bus, and it is quite easy to get around. We suggest that you use G-Maps when you have decided on a destination and make an itinerary since it is the easiest way to get the best and quickest connections. If you like walking it is also a nice way to see the city and for instance it doesn't take too long to get to the center of the city - about 15 min. by bus.  Approximate time distance with public transportation/walking, to some of the most popular destinations in Copenhagen:  - The airport: 40 min. - Tivoli: 25 min.  - Bakken (another amusement park open in summertime: 40 min.  - The little mermaid: 40 min. - Runde T\u00e5rn (Round Tower): 20 min.  - Christiania: 40 min.  - Nyhavn: 30 min.  - Str\u00f8get: 25 min.  - Christiansborg Slot (Castle): 30 min.  - Copenhagen Zoo: 40 min.  - The National Museum: 30 min.",

If you're easily offended by a little trash in the streets, furniture on the sidewalk, a couple homeless people, or ice cream trucks this place might not be for you.   The neighborhood is hustling & bustling... kids playing, families walking, people fixing their cars, junk trunks, street vendors, church worship, tamale ladies, people congregating after a long work day. On weekends it isn't uncommon to hear music coming from neighborhood celebrations.  It is SAFE to walk around at any time of the day.   Occasionally there is police activity such as helicopter/patrols.  Not as bad as it sounds, but Im giving you the all the info, so there are no surprises or miscommunications. Please consider this a disclaimer, as it is unfair to reflect things out of my control such as \"neighborhood\" in review ratings regarding location.",

It may be considered \"Gritty\"  but its rich in culture, local flavor & access to everything you want to do when visiting LA. See \"The Neighborhood\" section. 3. NOISE - this neighborhood is bustling, its not uncommon to hear mariachi music, quince\u00f1eras, church worship, or live music.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

For Japanese food I would recommend Little Tokyo, for authentic Mexican food there is La Placita Olvera located close to Union Station. Papa Cristo's good for Greek food. You also have the option to visit all the restaurants inside the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Mall. Staples Center is just few minutes away! It is surrounded by a series of other cool places and even more restaurants. Head a little closer to Union Station and you will have a big selection of bars, restaurants and cafes. Just within few blocks there is Senor Fish (fish tacos, ceviches and other Mexican faves), Spitz (Turkish street food), Mr. Ramen (curry and vegetarian), Sushi & Teri, Hama Sushi and the list goes on.  The Grove (great outdoor mall to enjoy sunny days) is not to far and this place has the very popular Farmers Market, theaters, shopping center and restaurants.",

But I LOVE cycling all over the world and I know how important it is to provide a friendly place for bike riders to feel at home. I want to make everyone feel welcome, but I also want to provide something specifically for cyclists.\r\nWhen I travel I love meeting the locals, and as a Melbourne girl I'd love to tell you about the best places to eat, visit, cycle and see in our wonderful town. And I've lived in the area of our AirBnB for around 20 years and I've seen it change an awful lot. I can tell you some history and also let you in on some local secrets!\r\nBut when I travel myself, I can't go past (URL HIDDEN) experience in Tokyo Japan and I was sold. So now it's my time to share the love and I hope you love our small but quirky and gorgeous place...we love it so much and hope you do too!",

We are located just minutes from Downtown, the Convention Center (LAKERS/DODGERS GAMES! E3, etc...) and Little Tokyo. As you might have heard, DTLA went through major renovations these past years.

We love the opportunity to travel with our jobs. For example, I'm in Japan right now working for Tokyo Disneyland and last year I had the opportunity to travel the country with a children's theatre company while Josh spent the summer in Husdon, NY performing in Cabaret.",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "neighborhood_overview": "GREAT neighborhood, like a central hub to central LA.  Yet we have absolutely privacy and peace here.  We consider this area paradise  to live in with good reason. Entertainment industry executive heavy, musicians, writers, artists, celebrities, stars, and we are surrounded by incredible flora and fauna, mountains and vistas. The property itself is a huge cactus garden, with a view of the Hollywood sign at the top.  We are 5 minutes from Universal studio and the new Harry Potter attraction, a short walk to Runyon Canyon. Hikers paradise  -- you can walk out the door and start hiking, we are 5 minutes from Hollywood, Studio City, Burbank, Mullholand Drive, Beachwood Canyon, Laurel Canyon (about 10 minutes), Burbank, Warner Brothers and other studios. 40 minutes from Beaches. Starbucks is a short walk down the hill, as well as a great local Japanese restaurant, a new sandwich/salad/juice shop and other amenities.  Other eateries within walking distance -- Mercado, Breakroom Cafe, Tokyo F",
    "notes": "I have two tiny little dogs that live upstairs! They love people and other dogs and they will love you!  They may bark to greet you but after we've met, you're their new best friend. They are great guard dogs, and the area is really safe nonetheless, it's nice to have them be so alert! The garage is my artist's studio. We live in a creative thriving environment. Please see neighborhood notes below for restaurant suggestions. Please note that there will be a pet fee charged, particularly for longer stays.",
    "transit": "Many people use Uber and Lyft very easily. There's a bus stop 1/4 mile away. You can walk to eateries, and Cahuenga Boulevard West. There are stairs down to Adina Drive/Oakshire and also toward Cahuenga. Red line metro is 5 minute drive and park at Universal City. I have off -street parking for you in large front driveway There is more street parking on Woodrow Wilson Drive. As stated above - the locale is ultra central. I can't think of a better place then Cahuenga Pass for being right in the thick of it, yet not in the thick of it, all at once. I'm not sure how we've managed this, but it's true! Also to note: the traffic in our area is extremely light by LA standards. If you need to do errands in the Valley, it's a breeze. Driving in and around the hills is tranquil and beautiful. Very little congestion in the surrounding environs.",
    "access": "The entire apartment, patio outside the door to the left is exclusively yours,   4500 sq ft front yard. Private entrance to apartment.",
    "interaction": "I would be happy to help you with anything you need throughout your stay just ask! I will also respect your privacy unless you need something. This is your chance to be a Hollywood Hills resident and have a peaceful stay. I am available if you need me, but if you don't I leave my guests alone.  Please do not hesitate to ask me for recommendations in the area. They are also listed here. ( under neighborhood notes)",
    "house_rules": "Please enjoy yourselves and be respectful of our neighbors.  The canyon is a unique audial experience. The apartment itself quiet inside, and you have very minimal noise throughout your stay, however outside sound travels throughout the canyon somewhat like an amphitheater so we keep our voices out of \" shouting\" version outside! Additinal note -- I am a pianist - classically trained, and learning jazz, theroy etc.  You may get the occasional classical concert, and the more plodding jazz practice. If I know your schedule somewhat I will try to practice when you are not home.  Please let me know i its a disturbance and I am happy to work around it. I don't practice all the time. Please park in the driveway/front area Some house rules are: please use cutting boards ONLY on the butcher's block counters in the kitchen.. They are totally new and my pride and joy.  No cutting etc, and just use the cutting boards that are provided and they will remain gorgeous for a long time! --NO SMOKING An",

Junior (the pup) is very friendly and loving. Sasha is a cuddle bug, and if you let her, will curl up in your lap like a baby and live there....forever. Haha! Red (the boyfriend's dog) does his own thing when he comes over. He's very sweet, but normally not interested in much, and just sleeps in my room. They  spend most of their time wherever I happen to be in the house, but they do like to say hello to our guests if they hear you in a common area. You must love dogs if you plan on staying here!  Everyone always loves our dogs, and are really impressed by how well behaved they are. We run a tight doggy ship here. :)) Also, please note that we do have another room that we rent out. So there's a good chance that there are other guests in the house. It never seems to be an issue, as everyone is normally off enjoying Nashvill",

My boyfriend, Paul, drops in frequently, but is not a permanent fixture in my home. He is very personable and friendly, and will most likely want to talk with you about his farming and Monolithic Domes, if you're interested. :) I am very busy for the most part, but I am always available if you need me. You can call or text me for anything at all throughout the day if I'm not around. When I am at home, I always enjoy interacting with my guests if they're willing! Most of all, I will insure that you have a positive and fun experience staying at my place!",

My dream destination is Tokyo, Japan, amongst many others. \r\n\r\nI love hosting and meeting new people while sharing and learning about their experiences and lives. As a host, I share my space openly and create a fun and positive environment for my guests. Everyone feels at home, and most feel as if we've known each other for a lifetime. As a guest, I am respectful, clean, interactive, cheerful and always grateful!\r\n\r\nMy motto in life is, \"She who dares, wins!\"",

I have met so many interesting people as a host and I look forward to those I will meet in the future.  \r\n\r\nI am a sports fan, reader, movie goer, and I like to try new things.  I play golf, basketball, and just about any sport you can think of.  I love ramen, yakiniku, yakitori, and shabu shabu here in Japan.   I love to try pizza all over the world when I travel.   \r\n\r\nRelationships are the most important thing for me in my personal life as well as business.  I like to go out and have a good time with my friends and meet new people.  \r\n\r\nI have learned so much from my over three years as an airbnb host and I am pleased to say I have most questions answered for you before you ask them, whether it be in the description of the listing or in the detail I supply you with at confirmation.  Still, I am always thinking of ways to make the guest experience more comfortable, efficient, and hassle free.   This is my goal as a host.  I will continue to get more places every month so I can host more travelers.  I want everyone to see Tokyo at least once!   \r\n\r\nTokyo is a great place to come and people from all over the world visit here making it a truly international city.  I love Tokyo and seeing the amazing sights and people.  It is a great place to explore and every day can be different.  This is an awesome destination for walkers and wanders filled with friendly people, tasty restaurants, and plenty of lights.   My tip is to make the initial contact with Japanese people because they are typically shy at first.   They will be happy to try to practice their English with you.\r\n\r\nHope I can host you soon!  May your trip to Tokyo be as amazing as my 7 years here has been!",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

In recent years though, a large number of restaurants and bars have popped up in the area (and would be an easy 15-20 minute walk from the flat), such as Obica, Iberica, and Royal China. I particularly like Chai Ki, a modern Indian restaurant. You can also get drinks or have afternoon tea at the lovely Radisson Blu hotel nearby the apartment complex, which is a great setting to meet friends. Or, you can just use the kitchen in the apartment to cook yourself a meal and enjoy a nice comfy stay.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

In recent years though, a large number of restaurants and bars have popped up in the area (and would be an easy 15-20 minute walk from the flat), such as Obica, Iberica, and Royal China. I particularly like Chai Ki, a modern Indian restaurant. You can also get drinks or have afternoon tea at the lovely Radisson Blu hotel nearby the apartment complex, which is a great setting to meet friends. Or, you can just use the kitchen in the apartment to cook yourself a meal and enjoy a nice comfy stay. With an iconic skyline towering over London, striking and dynamic architecture and a vibrant, cosmopolitan feel, Canary Wharf is firmly established as a first class shopping and leisure destination There are plenty of bars, pubs, restaurants, luxury stores to shop and a massive shopping mall.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

I have been living in Berlin for the last 6.5 years now, Holy MolY! 3.5 of those years have been spent here in this lovely flat in Schoeneberg, one of the coolest areas of Berlin (alright, they are ALL cool). But recently i have been falling more and more in love with this area, as it is such a mix of people and ages and backgrounds and more and more galleries and cafes are popping up close by, but it doesn't have the same trendy, fast changeability of Neukolln or even Kreuzberg. It is consistant and sure of itself...like me...? Haha, maybe its rubbing off a little bit :D Anyway, I live here with my two roommates, one of which is my best friend and the other is Reinhardt, a German man in his 60s who loves to watch football and a good deal at Aldi. He is very sweet and keeps to himself mostly, or just isn't home.\r\n\r\nAside from an artists/designer I am an English teacher and avid traveler. I was lucky enough to go on a sort of world tour last year, starting with NY and ending with Tokyo, with SF and SD and S.K somewhere in the middle. I absolutely fell in love with Japan (Kyoto/Osaka and Tokyo) and MUST get back there to spend some real time there...like a year!\r\n\r\nI love to eat, drink, laugh, dance and create and certainly love to meet people from all over, building those connections that are so important to our SouL!",

During the day it's buzzing, the locals mix with a lot of creatives (advertising agencies and record labels are based in the area) and bankers (you can see the financial district and skyscrapers if you go up to the top floor of the building). Research the area online. East is different to west London where you'll find Big Ben, Covent Garden etc - although they are 15 mins on the tube from the flat. It has more housing blocks, it's more built up. The building: it used to be a cinema and film studio and is attached to a famous boxing hall and swimming pool... with a hotel covered in artistic metal next to it - it's as random and weird as the area itself. Not ideal for families, young children or those looking for a very quiet part of London.",
    "notes": "Do your research before you choose this area. Whilst my apartment is certainly in and around central London, it is far removed from common perceptions of London. This is the east-end: it's old looking but full of young people, it's colourful, it can be noisy, it may even seem chaotic, it's definitely very busy and bustling. What's it not is the west-end, so if you're looking for the London you see in films, the east-end is probably not for you.",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "neighborhood_overview": "It is a relatively quiet residential neighborhood with a lot of park space and trees between buildings. The style of the buildings is quite unique as they where build as a complex during the 60's with the aesthetics of that time. While walking around you will see interesting ways the residents have used to modify their spaces with small gardens in front of the ground floor apartments or added balconies on higher ones. There is a sense of old style neighborhood with residents spending time at the parks or local cafes and restaurants in the evenings or chatting at the streets and I find early evenings hours there quite picturesque with the tram passing through.  The farmers' market there every Saturday is quite large and very cheap so I recommend you to visit it for shopping or for just watching some interesting friendly characters selling their products there. It runs cross and by the tram lines and it finishes around 15:00 so you can get the best prices just before then.",
    "notes": null,
    "transit": "For nightlife. you can visit the cafes and some restaurants on the way to the metro or you can easily take the metro to go anywhere. If you don't feel like commuting and you don't mind walking a bit, in 20 min you can be at the busier Koukaki area where there are many more cafes and restaurants. One of the busiest parts of it is right outside Sygrou-Fix metro station. Of course you can also ride the metro for one stop to go there. I usually just walk.   You can even walk to the old town Plaka or the Acropolis if you don't want to use the train. You can reach the Acropolis in 30 min (walk) and you can enter Plaka in 25 min. By metro that can be much shorter as two stops from Neos Kosmos to the Acropolis station take less than 5 min.  For art lovers, you can walk in 7 min to the National Museum of Contemporary Art and 5 min to the Onassis Cultural Center. Please (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) them. The Acropolis museum is also in less than 30 min walking distance.",
    "access": "My space is very conveniently located for exploring Athens and for even going to the beach as the tram (5 min walk to the tram stop) can take you to the nearest Athenian beaches. Coming from the airport or the Piraeus port isn't complicated. From the airport you only need to change train once at \"Syntagma\" station, take the red line towards \"Ellinikon\" and get off at \"Neos Kosmos\" station which is only 7 min walk away from the apartment. From Piraeus port you change trains at \"Omonia\" station to the red line again towards \"Ellinikon\" and get off at \"Neos Kosmos\" station again. From the port it is also easy and much faster to get a taxi as highways connect it to Syngrou avenue from where you can directly turn in to my street.",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

We also get asked sometimes; 'Are you close to the city centre where all traditional attractions are?  The answer is; no one place in London is close to all the attractions because they are spread around London. You will have to use the transport system to get around and the transport system in London is one of the best in the world, we are well sited as a launchpad to visit most areas of london and of course have our own unique scene on the doorstep.

I have traveled to most major cities in the US, and very few out of the country. However, I am ready to see the world! My dream destination is Tokyo, Japan, amongst many others. \r\n\r\nI love hosting and meeting new people while sharing and learning about their experiences and lives. As a host, I share my space openly and create a fun and positive environment for my guests. Everyone feels at home, and most feel as if we've known each other for a lifetime. As a guest, I am respectful, clean, interactive, cheerful and always grateful!\r\n\r\nMy motto in life is, \"She who dares, wins!\"",

    "host_about": "My name is Fabio and I along with my friend and colleague Willian will ensure to provide you a wonderful stay in our apartments across London.\r\n\r\nWillian, Throughout his extensive travels, his unusual name \u2013 a derivative of William \u2013 has led to much curiosity. An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

Although I no longer work on the Front Desk, I'm still the owner - so I interview all the staff (in Japanese) and I taste everything on the menu.\r\n\r\nMy flat is just the other side of Chinatown and I have a couple of extra bedrooms which are needed when chefs and other visitors come over from Japan. However, those rooms are empty for most of the time, so that's why I have decided to start using Airbnb.\r\n\r\nMy motto is \"clean living, fun loving\". I have always liked to exercise in the parks (just four minutes away) and, in the last couple of years, I have been completely taken over by Swing dancing (Lindyhop, Blues, Balboa). There is a real explosion of Swing in London at the moment and I usually go dancing five or six nights a week - so it's really convenient that I live in the centre of town!",

The neighborhood is hustling & bustling... kids playing, families walking, people fixing their cars, junk trunks, furniture on the sidewalks, a couple harmless homeless guys, church worship, ice cream trucks, tamale ladies in the morning, people congregating after a long work day. During weekends it isn't  uncommon to hear mariachi or latin music coming from quince\u00f1eras, birthday parties, baby showers. Occasionally there is police activity such as helicopter/patrols.

Apart from driving and public transport, San Francisco has literally thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers and it is never more than about a 5 minute wait to have a car pull up at the front door.

I also consider myself a citizen of the world, as I have traveled to 49 countries so far and in addition to English, speak some Japanese and French. \r\n\r\nIn my travels, I have stayed at some amazing places and know what a difference great hospitality can make to a trip. I therefore strive to create an experience at Bali Hai Castro that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back each time you return to San Francisco to stay here agin. \r\n\r\nI know the city and surrounding area very well and am always happy to give suggestions to make your stay exceptional. I am also a foodie and am working on a type of food blog \u2014 so if you are looking for great restaurants, I can share with you my favorites.\r\n\r\nAs a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it really affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.\r\n\r\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my puppy (Dexter), working out, hiking, traveling, skiing, and generally making the most of life. \r\n\r\nIf you are considering booking my home, I know you will love your stay here!\r\n\r\nIf I have made a reservation request with you, I can promise that you will be delighted to have me as a guest.\r\n\r\nHope to meet you soon,\r\n\r\nLaurence",

Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there.

That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years.

    "host_about": "My name is Fabio and I along with my friend and colleague Willian will ensure to provide you a wonderful stay in our apartments across London.\r\n\r\nWillian, Throughout his extensive travels, his unusual name \u2013 a derivative of William \u2013 has led to much curiosity. An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

So far, so good, thanks to the excellent people who come and stay in my house, and who let me into theirs, long before AirB&B.\r\n\r\nI've  living and working part of each year in Australia, part in Tokyo, and little working trips all over the place.\r\n\r\nI write a Magazine column in Japanese, 'Cecilia's Permacutlure Slow Life'. Its about creative ways to de-trap your life of wasted time, energy and affection, freeing you up to do the good work you were put on this world to do. \r\n\r\nFor 9 years Ive run a share-house for creative people - you can read about it on my Blog Balcony Garden dreaming\r\n\r\nMy hobbies are Sado (Japanese tea eremony), balcony gardening, fancy dress parties, and drawing illustrations of the quirky world I would like to live in, and often actually do.  These are also my jobs.\r\n\r\nIve been a WWOOF host and traveler for many years (willing workers on organic farms). Even when my farm was just a balcony garden. \r\n\r\nI don't have a life motto exactly, but when thing go wrong, I ask myself 'Whiner or designer?', and that gets me positive and resourceful, finding a way to make things better.\r\nIf things go wrong for you I won't say it though. I'll just help where I can xx",

I'll provide a link to the map upon booking. Great eats: Dusek's, Punch House, Nightwood, Skylark, Bodhi Thai, Honky Tonk BBQ, etc. etc. etc... East Pilsen AKA Chicago's Historic Arts District has lots of cool galleries and is perhaps best known for its open gallery walks where you can check out a tons of galleries or open art studios and see all sorts of art made by local artists. Peppered with rad wall murals and vibrant and diverse cultures I definitely think Pilsen is one of the best neighborhoods to call home in Chicago. (Hence, my address.) 1.5 miles from Mccormick Place. Great place to stay while in town for an expo or convention to be close by but still get to take in this great neighborhood.",

In my photography work I focus mainly on travel, live music, interior design and architecture as well as various other forms of commercial photography to keep the bills paid.\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio and moved to Chicago 11 years ago. Aside from a few months spent in Nicaragua after college, a few months in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and a month in Tokyo in 2015, I've stayed and absolutely loved living in Chicago. Other travels have included Prague, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Panama, Costa Rica, Japan, Uruguay, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and I'm gearing up for a very exciting few weeks photographing and filming in Kenya and Rwanda for a documentary series about extraordinary women doing great things around the world. \r\n\r\nI enjoy cooking but not as much as I like going out to dinner. I am equally as comfortable in a dive bar drinking cheap beer at the pool table as I am in a high end restaurant drinking fine wine and whiskey. Though, in an ideal world I would be sipping fine wine or whiskey at the dive bar pool table.\r\n\r\nI see A LOT of live music, partially because I photograph a lot of musician portraits and live concerts for various publications, but ultimately just because I enjoy many types of music very much. \r\n\r\nI love meeting new people from all over the world and hope we get to meet very soon.",

Red (the boyfriend's dog) does his own thing when he comes over. He's very sweet, but normally not interested in much, and just sleeps in my room. They  spend most of their time wherever I happen to be in the house, but they do like to say hello to our guests if they hear you in a common area. You must love dogs if you plan on staying here!  Everyone always loves our dogs, and are really impressed by how well behaved they are. We run a tight doggy ship here. :)) Also, please note that we do have another room that we rent out. So there's a good chance that there are other guests in the house. It never seems to be an issue, as everyone is normally off enjoying Nashvill",

    "neighborhood_overview": "I absolutely adore the area I live in!!! It's super green, safe and quiet with the park and the small lake just across the street, you can walk to river Spree across the park.  At the same time, it\"s really close to all the happening areas, Kreuzberg, Neuk\u00f6lln and Friedrichshain. If you don\"t want to walk there or take a taxi, feel free to use my bicyles to get around!",
    "notes": "One important reminder at this point:  I am a dog lover and my adorable dog Luna lives me in my flat. I do not believe that dogs are in any way unhygienic, at least not more than humans.  It is unavoidable despite all efforts to clean and hover the flat that there will be places where you spot dog hair.  If that is something that bothers or concerns you, I recommend looking for alternative options.",
    "transit": "My place is conveniently located to public transport: closest S-bahn station is \"Treptower Park\" on the ring (circle) train  10min leisurely walk  through the park and bus stop just outside of the house",
    "access": "I like my guests to feel 'at home away from home'.  With that, there are no limits to communal areas and rooms they can access or use, as long as they keep them clean and ready for use by others.  I appreciate if guests are not hiding in their room and keeping to themselves but I do encourage them to share the public spaces.  On the same note, I expect that guests do not regard their room as their private property and accept that I may have to access the room to get some things or occasionally use it while they are not using it themselves.  I am looking at this more than a shared flat with temporary guests than a hotel where people check in, do their thing and check out.  Of course, mutual respect and trust is the basis for this kind of openness which is both granted  by myself as well as expected from my guests.",
    "interaction": "The level of interaction with my guests generally depends on a range of different factors such as my guest's travel plans, my own work and social calendar how much interaction we will have. Generally speaking, I do find the social dimension of AirBnB at least equally attractive as the financial award as a host. Therefore, I do not like guests to treat me as an employee in a hotel that will do the check-in and check-out but would like to remind everyone that for whatever limited time we have, we are sharing together this space, with me included. Interaction and communication between us make these moments much more valuable and interesting for both myself and my guests.  I greatly enjoy sharing with my guests my story, my view of Berlin, favorite places, clubs, art venues, cafes, neighborhoods and the reasons why I love this city more than any other.   The fascinating thing for me is this: I always learn something new from my guests that I did not know, experienced or paid attention to!",
    "house_rules": "I kindly ask my guest to respect the following house rules:  1. Kindly remove your shoes when entering the flat, I am happy to provide some extra shoes for the house. That protects the antique wooden parquet floor and reduces the noise level for my downstairs neighbor.  2. Smoking is not permitted inside the flat, only on both balconies. 3. Please respect my neighbors and avoid excessive noise in the flat, particularly between 10pm and 8am. This also includes the staircase when you return late at night.  NOTE: my downstairs neighbor has his bedroom under my kitchen. Noise travels more easily in an old house like mine. I recommend using the living room when you want to sit together in the evening to have drinks.  4. Parties are explicitly NOT allowed, unless you have prior approval, particularly if it involves inviting non-guests to the flat.  5. Please keep the kitchen area clean and tidy, put away into the dishwasher or wash any dirty dishes. 6. One last important house rule for MALE",

    "host_about": "Hi there, I am George and proud to be AirBnB Superhost for the 10th time in a row! I love hosting people from all over the world. \r\nWhat I enjoyed most during my 18-month travel around the world a few years ago was to spend time with friends who were kind enough to host me in their homes (San Francisco, Tokyo, Miami, Rio de Janeiro just to name a few). Now that I have settled down in my favorite city Berlin, I love to return the  favor and open up my place to guests from other countries and cultures to make it their home away from home.\r\nI am a gay man, currently living by myself  with my adorable dog Luna, a German short hair pointer after my longtime Brazilian partner from Rio de Janeiro moved out to start a degree in 'Fashion Branding'  @ Amsterdam Fashion Institute (AmFI). I have always enjoyed hosting other people, showing them my city and sharing with them my view of Berlin, what to do and how to make the most of their time. \r\nProfessionally, I work as an business consultant for a big American company. As a balance for my creative half I like art (both visiting exhibitions as well as getting my own small eclectic collection), going for long walks with my dog in the country side around Berlin, architecture, traveling, enjoying the amazing cultural offers in Berlin ranging from opera to nights (and days) in my favorite club Berghain. But above all, I am  a huge fan of Franco-Belgian comics such as Tintin, Blake & Mortimer, Sopie & Starter etc. Not only do I collect these comics but I also collect art work such as Aroutcheff toys, cars and vehicles. \r\nThe other passion is decorating my apartement with rare antiques and art work. It makes me proud that virtually anyone who comes to visit immediately falls in love with my flat. \r\nMy favorite author is Haruki Murakami, about time he gets the Nobel prize for literature! Favorite destinations are Nepal, Japan and Easter Islands. \r\nIf I am not busy enjoying the cultural attractions of Berlin, I love watching well made US series e.g. Sopranos, The Wire and Game of Thrones. \r\nFavorite directors are Pedro Almodovar, David Lynch, Jim Jarmusch and Francois Truffeaut. \r\nIf you stay with me, you should not be afraid of dogs. I would like my guests to really feel at home at my place and invite them to the  entire space rather than just their room for cooking, relaxing, borrowing my books or taking a sun bath on one of my balconies. \r\nMy leitmotiv is \"Work hard & party hard\" and \"Live and let live\", I am tolerant towards other views and opinions as long as they do the same. I hate intolerant and hypocritical people who think they have eaten the truth with a spoon. Gay and lesbian friendly!",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The Canary Wharf area is traditionally known to be the beating heart of London\u2019s financial sector, full of tall buildings housing international banks. In recent years though, a large number of restaurants and bars have popped up in the area (and would be an easy 15-20 minute walk from the flat), such as Obica, Iberica, and Royal China. I particularly like Chai Ki, a modern Indian restaurant. You can also get drinks or have afternoon tea at the lovely Radisson Blu hotel nearby the apartment complex, which is a great setting to meet friends. Or, you can just use the kitchen in the apartment to cook yourself a meal and enjoy a nice comfy stay. With an iconic skyline towering over London, striking and dynamic architecture and a vibrant, cosmopolitan feel, Canary Wharf is firmly established as a first class shopping and leisure destination There are plenty of bars, pubs, restaurants, luxury stores to shop and a massive shopping mall.  Canary Wharf is a major business district located in Tow",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

Portobello Road goes straight through the heart of Notting Hill, the trendy area of London made famous by the film. Indeed, so famous is the film Notting Hill that I find scarcely a week goes by without someone or other asking me about the various set locations: the blue door, the travel bookshop, the garden fence and so on. Portobello Market takes up most of what is actually more properly called Portobello Road, it stretches for around two miles, although on a crowded saturday afternoon it takes quite a while to walk from end to end.",

Los Feliz Village also boasts some of the best restaurants in Los Angeles. A great place for Star spotting. Grab a coffee and a book at Skylight Bookstore or see a movie at a vintage theater. Families and outdoorsy folks will love that we",
    "notes": "As mentioned several times, this is our family home. We have two young children who live upstairs. We are very busy during the week so you will not hear from us much between 7:30a.m. and 4p.m. However we are early risers, 7 a.m., and you may hear us getting ready for school during the weekdays.  Weekends we are often home. You will hear us going about our business upstairs. Your floor is very private, and we cannot access it if you have it locked. People traveling with children can feel free to send their children outside to play any time. Our backyard is enclosed and full of fun nature activities! We have a tire swing and a shed full of toys!",
    "transit": "We are located near the 2 freeway, 110 freeway, 210 freeway, 134 freeway and 5 freeways. 35 minutes to LAX, 15 minutes to Burbank and 40 minute to Disneyland. The Vermont & Sunset Metro station is not far but you would need to take a 5-6 Uber to get there. The Red line runs from here and will take you directly to some great neighborhoods: Downtown, The Staple Center, Olivera Street, Little Tokyo and Union Station. From Union Station you can connect to trains taking you all around L.A. and beyond - including the beach.",
    "access": "There is no kitchen access. There is a mini refrigerator and microwave. We will provide an electric kettle/coffee machine and mugs for you to use. If you plan on BBQing let us know and we will bring you plates and utensils to enjoy your outdoor meal. Street parking is available during the week, but can be tricky on the weekends. You can use our driveway when we are not home or temporarily until you find an open space.",
    "interaction": "I work during the week from 8 a.m. - 4p.m. but am only 5 minutes away if you need anything. The house will be very quiet during these hours as no one will be home. We do like to BBQ and play outside on the weekends. You are welcome to join us for a family meal (my husband and I love to cook), otherwise we will leave you alone. If you want any entertainment or restaurant tips ask away!",
    "house_rules": "- We expect you to be considerate of our family who lives upstairs. Quiet hours between 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. - Brand new carpet in your room. Please remove shoes at the door.  - Two young children live upstairs. This is their home and they will be playing in the backyard from time to time. If the sound of children playing bothers you, this is not the rental for you. The house is usually not occupied between 8:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. during the weekdays. It is very quiet during those hours.",

When the girls are sleeping I love lounging on the couch watching movies with my husband or planning our next family adventure.\r\n\r\nWe love to host families from all over the world. We have shared our home with families from France, Spain, London, Japan and Poland. Also some locals have taken advantage of our family friendly space.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Historic East Adams is on the edge of everything downtown L A has to offer! And it has a lot! Exploring every unique area just DTLA will take you weeks! Historic gallery row, Japan & China towns, Olvira Street (oldest street in LA), fantastic hipster arts district, Santee Alley, Fashion District. Flower Mart, Jewelry district, Staples, LA Live, Nokia theatre, Geffen, MOCA, The Broad....Then there's USC, The Coliseum, Natural History Museum. I'm trying to list everything but I know I'm missing lots. Gallery Row is located in the center of Downtown Los Angeles near the Civic Center, Historic Core, Old Bank, and the Fashion District. With the Walt Disney Concert Hall and MOCA on Grand Avenue to the north west, Little Tokyo to the north east. Your stay is well positioned as a hub of cultural activity & most of it is totally walkable! Take the dowtown DASH to Chinatown (the other side of DTLA from where U will B) Or hop on the Metro & B in Hollywood, Long Beach, Culver City or No. Ho. in mi",
    "notes": "All is very clean & well stocked with everything U need to cook. Milk, eggs, bread,  yogurts, fresh fruits (sometimes from my garden) coffee, exotic teas & more will be stocked in the fridge upon arrival. The building is still being renovated to some degree. It is over 100 years old. My dad tells me I will be doing it for the rest of my life. lol However lower unit (your unit), have no fear, is finished. Lots of plug ins, hi speed internet, huge 65\"TV with my netflix account hooked in....I've tried to think of everything. I did work for Hilton Hotel Corp for many years, so I'm sure you will love it here and you will be very comfortable. On July 4th, NY eve, Halloween it can get raucous with noise from Staples or USC games at The Coliseum but the bedrooms do not face the street so most of the time it is very quiet. Shockingly quiet since you are on the edge of downtown/total action & the 2nd largest city in America.",
    "transit": "2 different Metro station-stops within 4 blocks - Fig/Adams and Washington/Grand will take you just about anywhere from Malibu to Bev. Hills, Hollywood, Pasadena, etc. Downtown Dash bus every 8 minutes within 6 blocks - Grand/Washington for 50 CENTS anywhere downtown/Chinatown/Grand Central/Arts District/Fashion District/Courthouse/etc.  I have current METRO maps, bus schedules, art tour maps, USC cultural event calendars, etc here for you to plan your day.",

Can dog sit for extra fee if you need it or your dog can enjoy the yard while you are out and about. I have a very friendly black lab who is well trained. I keep her indoors, under my guidance unless U request her company. :) So she will not be in your space, however friendly she is.",

Doggie doo-doo bags provided-please pick up immediate. Smoking outside in designated areas with ashtrays. No parties. No late night noise after 10ish pm. If it looks over 100 yrs old, it is.

So I will make sure your stay is comfortable, delightful & fun if that is what you are in the city of angels for. I am an artist in every sense. You will see my artist touches everywhere in the house and garden. I have always lived a unique life and it shows. You are perfectly situated to walk to events at The Staples Center go street art viewing in the arts district or the historic gallery row or the Geffen Gallery or the biggy galleries DTLA. You will be within walking distance to SANTE ALLEY & the fashion district to shop the great deals. There is just too much going on DTLA to list here. Like Mexican? Authentic Mexican food? Really authentic. Best night time taco pop up stands and tamales I've ever had at the end of the block! And that pretty much sums up what your stay will be with me in my Casa Grande.

I do try to escape at least once a year to discover somewhere new. \r\n\r\nHoliday Highlights include: Hitch-hiking around Alaska & Canada, Yoga & surf retreats in Bali, La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, the cenotes & margaritas of Mexico. I've Managed a Backpackers Hostel in Canada, served Guinness in Belfast & snowboarded in Austria, Canada, New Zealand & Japan. \r\n\r\nI also trained as a Ninja in Tokyo ;)\r\n\r\nI love to immerse myself in a place to discover & experience sights, food, markets, music, activities and local life. It's meeting the locals & other explorers along the way that has enriched these experiences.\r\n\r\nThis is why I am excited to be a host to fellow travellers.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Melbourne :)",

(Missouri City, Texas) Date of stay 08/14/13Review Submitted 08/28/13 Where do I start, my family and I spent part of our summer vacation here. The house was wonderful, Kevin was an angel for accommodating us especially since it was last minute as we were driving into LA. I have never slept with the windows open but this home sleeping with the windows open was so peaceful and the view from all areas of the home were great. The kitchen is fully stocked with every dish, pan, pot, utensil that you can think of. We only had to buy toilet tissue and paper towels. Reading earlier reviews parking was great for us each night we could park in the street by the home. The location is perfect we walked from the home to Hollywood boulevard in less than 10 minutes. Six flags about 30 minutes, Universal Studios around the corner, Hollywood Bowl is right above the home. We will defiantly stay here on our future trips to LA. Thanks Kevin! Recommended fo",

We expect our guests to be courteous and respectful to our neighbors and be aware that noise in the hollywood hills travels VERY easily and is amplified quickly.  After 10pm we request that any open windows be closed if there are loud conversations, movies or music playing, and we request that we be notified if any groups of more than 6 people are present. This unit is below many bedrooms and above another, so we request that late night noise and 'running' be kept to a minimum, and a shoe rack is provided at the door to facilitate that :)  This property does NOT work well for raucous parties or loud music.

As such there are people with drug addiction, prostitution and other related challenges. That said, the area has been undergoing a transition with artist studios, high tech startups (until recently Hoot Suite was in the hood) and some cool coffee shops and restaurants opening up. I personally live here and I like the community and have always felt safe, as do the young professionals that rent out suites in my building.

    "neighborhood_overview": "Northcote is a buzzy, happening neighbourhood. Separation Street is an active street that links directly with the main drag of High Street, about 8 mins walk from the house. This has everything including a large shopping plaza, but its vibe is more about boutique, cool little shops and bars. There's several live music venues, cool bars, and a good selection of options for eating out. The suburbs either side are Westgarth and Thornbury, which also have good places to eat and drink. The bus out the front goes to Brunswick which is a cultural eating mecca with yet more bars and shops (!), and Fitzroy is just 4 minutes away, with more buzz and things to do, including a range of good galleries. CBD is about 14 mins on the train. Whilst we are in the thick of action, the All Nations Park behind our house has several kid's playgrounds, native bush plantings, and loads of open space. At the far end of our street, approx 4 mins drive, is the Darebin Parklands, a massive green wedge of native bu",

Also, Little Tokyo is about a 5 minute walk away and is a goldmine of interesting Japanese restaurants, karaoke and shopping.",
    "notes": "This apartment requires walking up 4 flights of stairs.  There is a freight elevator, but it not conveniently accessible. Since the loft is on the 4th floor of an apartment building we ask that guests are considerate of neighbors regarding noise level.  This apartment is a beloved home, so please be respectful.",
    "transit": "Super walkable neighborhood.  Biking is also great.  Lyft/Uber are easy here.  The nearest subway station is the Little Tokyo/Art District Station (Metro Gold Line) and is about a 5-7 minute walk from the building. Additionally, the DASH bus stop is 2 blocks from the building, which goes to the historic core section of downtown.",
    "access": "Laundry is available on the basement floor via the freight elevator.",
    "interaction": "Myself and my assistant typically meet guests upon check-in and are available via text/phone for questions and any issues that arise.  The written apartment guide located in the space has suggestions for restaurants, bars, groceries, and details about wifi, etc.",
    "house_rules": "No smoking, pets, or parties in the building.  Guests must be respectful of neighbors, especially regarding noise/volume.  No commercial filming. No candles or incense.",

Between us we speak English, French, Spanish and some Japanese. We encourage families to visit our home.  We have two boys.\r\n\r\nI have a BFA in fine art and before having children I started my own business with the money I saved in Japan doing decorative painting in high end homes. Gold leaf, sky ceilings, lime wash finishes, frescoes, egg tempera and other decorative finishes. I LOVE to paint, design and draw! \r\n\r\nJavier and I are also crazy about Japanese design and we are inspired by the culture, architecture and food. Maybe you will feel a Japanese sensibility when you visit?",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

It's the main attraction in Williamsburg, and thick with specialty coffee shops, boutiques, and restaurants competing for attention. It's also home to Smorgasburg, a famous outdoor food market in East River Park, and Music Hall of Williamsburg, one of the better small venues in town. McCarren Park is a short walk away, and is usually filled with young people on the weekends exercising, shopping at the local farmers market, and hanging out on the grass with their friends, kids, and dogs. To the West, Greenpoint is a 5-10 minute walk towards the river, and is filled with vintage stores, specialty restaurants, and other hidden gems. To the East, Bushwick's Morgan and Jefferso",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The Canary Wharf area is traditionally known to be the beating heart of London\u2019s financial sector, full of tall buildings housing international banks. In recent years though, a large number of restaurants and bars have popped up in the area (and would be an easy 15-20 minute walk from the flat), such as Obica, Iberica, and Royal China. I particularly like Chai Ki, a modern Indian restaurant.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

In addition to French gems, try our favorite tapas restaurant or the best Japanese food east of Tokyo. Take your morning coffee in one of numerous bakeries.

    "host_about": "Hi, I'm Richard. 25 years ago, I opened a very popular little Japanese restaurant in London's Chinatown called Tokyo Diner.  Although I no longer work on the Front Desk, I'm still the owner - so I interview all the staff (in Japanese) and I taste everything on the menu.\r\n\r\nMy flat is just the other side of Chinatown and I have a couple of extra bedrooms which are needed when chefs and other visitors come over from Japan. However, those rooms are empty for most of the time, so that's why I have decided to start using Airbnb.\r\n\r\nMy motto is \"clean living, fun loving\". I have always liked to exercise in the parks (just four minutes away) and, in the last couple of years, I have been completely taken over by Swing dancing (Lindyhop, Blues, Balboa). There is a real explosion of Swing in London at the moment and I usually go dancing five or six nights a week - so it's really convenient that I live in the centre of town!",

    "host_about": "My name is Fabio and I along with my friend and colleague Willian will ensure to provide you a wonderful stay in our apartments across London.\r\n\r\nWillian, Throughout his extensive travels, his unusual name \u2013 a derivative of William \u2013 has led to much curiosity. An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

I graduated from the University of North Carolina - Charlotte in 1995 and received my B.A. in English Literature. I moved to Tokyo, Japan to teach English in 1998 and loved my two years there. I hope to move back there one day! In 2000, I moved to San Francisco. After being a resident here for almost 17 years, I still think it's the most beautiful city I've ever seen. I moved to Bernal Heights in 2011 and it's been my favorite neighborhood I've lived in in San Francisco. Bernal is more like a little village with amazing walk ability, shops, cafes and Bernal Mountain has some of the best views in the city.  I work in Sales and my hobbies are cooking, baking, hiking, camping, reading, playing tennis, dining out, traveling and spending time with my son, husband and Poodle-Mix, Sunny.  On my bucket list for places to visit are: Spain, Peru, Morocco, Cuba, Switzerland, Scotland, Vietman and Australia. Some of my favorite places I've traveled to are: Japan, Thailand, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands and New Zealand. My favorite books are: \"East of Eden\" and \"Frankenstein\" and my husband and I enjoy watching: Homeland, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things and  American Crime. I love meeting people from all over the world and hope to meet you and host you soon!",

    "host_about": "I am French, living in Paris for around 15 years, I know very well the city and good restaurants, I would be happy to share my best addresses with you ! I travel a lot for work and holidays. I am keen on Asian culture, first time in Tokyo was fantastic, I hope to visit Seoul soon as well as Vietnam and rest of Japan. I love museums, each week-end I try to see an exhibition, Paris is amazing for that, culture is promoted all year long. Cinema is also one of my passion, I love indie movies, \"cin\u00e9ma d'auteur\" like we say in French and Asian cinema. In the mood for love from Wong Kar Wai is my favorite movie.\r\nMy new other passion is cycling, Paris is making efforts to become a bike friendly city. I love visiting cities on a bike when I travel. We have VELIB here, don't hesitate to rent a bike to discover Paris !",

Clapham Junction boasts the famous Clapham Grand, a venue hosting a great variety of events depending on the night. Most tastes are catered for in the Grand at some time or other, and the place has a great feel to it. Inigo is a much smaller bar/club about five minutes from the station, and plays a wide range of funky house and dance music along with regular promotional drinks offers. Clapham Junction also has a Rileys' 24-hour pool bar, which is a bit of a boys club and hosts both pool and poker tournaments.",

There are no Underground stations in Clapham Junction but with so many trains, it hardly seems to matter. The station also provides you with the opportunity for a day out almost anywhere in the south of England without too much hassle. The High Street has three stations on the Northern Line (Clapham South, North and Common), which can all have you in the West End or the city in fifteen minutes . Clapham High Street, a small usually unmanned station, also has a service to Victoria. The area also has regular night buses from central London; so you'll never have to leave your drink/pull/friends to go and catch that irritatingly full last train home.",

    "host_about": "My name is Fabio and I along with my friend and colleague Willian will ensure to provide you a wonderful stay in our apartments across London.\r\n\r\nWillian, Throughout his extensive travels, his unusual name \u2013 a derivative of William \u2013 has led to much curiosity. An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

If you don\"t want to walk there or take a taxi, feel free to use my bicyles to get around!",
    "notes": "One important reminder at this point:  I am a dog lover and my adorable dog Luna lives me in my flat. I do not believe that dogs are in any way unhygienic, at least not more than humans.  It is unavoidable despite all efforts to clean and hover the flat that there will be places where you spot dog hair.  If that is something that bothers or concerns you, I recommend looking for alternative options.",
    "transit": "My place is conveniently located to public transport: closest S-bahn station is \"Treptower Park\" on the ring (circle) train  10min leisurely walk  through the park and bus stop just outside of the house.",
    "access": "I like my guests to feel at home away from home. With that, there are no limits to communal areas and rooms they can access or use, as long as they keep them clean and ready for use by others.  I appreciate if guests are not hiding in their room and keeping to themselves but I do encourage them to share the public spaces.  On the same note, I expect that guests do not regard their room as their private property and accept that I may have to access the room to get some things or use it while they are not using it themselves.  I am looking at this more than a shared flat with temporary guests than a hotel where people check in, do their thing and check out.  Of course, mutual respect and trust is the basis for this kind of openness which is both granted  by myself as well as expected from my guests.",
    "interaction": "The level of interaction with my guests generally depends on a range of different factors such as my guest's travel plans, my own work and social calendar how much interaction we will have. Generally speaking, I do find the social dimension of AirBnB at least equally attractive as the financial award as a host. Therefore, I do not like guests to treat me as an employee in a hotel that will do the check-in and check-out but would like to remind everyone that for whatever limited time we have, we are sharing together this space, with me included. Interaction and communication between us make these moments much more valuable and interesting for both myself and my guests.  I greatly enjoy sharing with my guests my story, my view of Berlin, favorite places, clubs, art venues, cafes, neighborhoods and the reasons why I love this city more than any other.   The fascinating thing for me is this: I always learn something new from my guests that I did not know, experienced or paid attention to!",
    "house_rules": "I kindly ask my guest to respect the following house rules:  1. Please remove your shoes when entering the flat, I am happy to provide some extra shoes for the house. That protects the antique wooden parquet floor and reduces the noise level for my downstairs neighbor.  2. Smoking is not permitted inside the flat, only on both balconies. 3. Please respect my neighbors and avoid excessive noise in the flat, particularly between 10pm and 8am. This also includes the staircase when you return late at night.  NOTE: my downstairs neighbor has his bedroom under my kitchen. Noise travels more easily in an old house like mine. I recommend using the living room when you want to sit together in the evening to have drinks.  4. Parties are explicitly NOT allowed, unless you have prior approval, particularly if it involves inviting non-guests to the flat.  5. Please keep the kitchen area clean and tidy, put away into the dishwasher or wash any dirty dishes. 6. One last important house rule for MALE",

I love hosting people from all over the world. \r\nWhat I enjoyed most during my 18-month travel around the world a few years ago was to spend time with friends who were kind enough to host me in their homes (San Francisco, Tokyo, Miami, Rio de Janeiro just to name a few). Now that I have settled down in my favorite city Berlin, I love to return the  favor and open up my place to guests from other countries and cultures to make it their home away from home.\r\nI am a gay man, currently living by myself  with my adorable dog Luna, a German short hair pointer after my longtime Brazilian partner from Rio de Janeiro moved out to start a degree in 'Fashion Branding'  @ Amsterdam Fashion Institute (AmFI). I have always enjoyed hosting other people, showing them my city and sharing with them my view of Berlin, what to do and how to make the most of their time. \r\nProfessionally, I work as an business consultant for a big American company. As a balance for my creative half I like art (both visiting exhibitions as well as getting my own small eclectic collection), going for long walks with my dog in the country side around Berlin, architecture, traveling, enjoying the amazing cultural offers in Berlin ranging from opera to nights (and days) in my favorite club Berghain. But above all, I am  a huge fan of Franco-Belgian comics such as Tintin, Blake & Mortimer, Sopie & Starter etc. Not only do I collect these comics but I also collect art work such as Aroutcheff toys, cars and vehicles. \r\nThe other passion is decorating my apartement with rare antiques and art work. It makes me proud that virtually anyone who comes to visit immediately falls in love with my flat. \r\nMy favorite author is Haruki Murakami, about time he gets the Nobel prize for literature! Favorite destinations are Nepal, Japan and Easter Islands. \r\nIf I am not busy enjoying the cultural attractions of Berlin, I love watching well made US series e.g. Sopranos, The Wire and Game of Thrones. \r\nFavorite directors are Pedro Almodovar, David Lynch, Jim Jarmusch and Francois Truffeaut. \r\nIf you stay with me, you should not be afraid of dogs. I would like my guests to really feel at home at my place and invite them to the  entire space rather than just their room for cooking, relaxing, borrowing my books or taking a sun bath on one of my balconies. \r\nMy leitmotiv is \"Work hard & party hard\" and \"Live and let live\", I am tolerant towards other views and opinions as long as they do the same. I hate intolerant and hypocritical people who think they have eaten the truth with a spoon. Gay and lesbian friendly!",

Also, I taught the basics of french cooking to Japanese clients.\r\n\r\nMy other hobby apart travelling is cooking and experiencing new trendy restaurants. I cook a lot of Asian food at home and my favorite is Thai food. In the summer, I love visiting the English countryside and it's always a delight.",

I fell in love when I saw so many dolphins playing with surfers near Bondi Beach on one glorious Saturday morning, just 20min away from CBD Sydney. Coming from Tokyo, I never forget how surprised I was! I have been living in beautiful Sydney ever since. \r\n\r\nWhen I met Peter,  he was already living in The Rocks/Millers Point where it's 5min walk to Sydney Harbour Bridge, 15min walks to Sydney Opera House yet quiet, absolutely a hidden gem. We enjoyed living there for a while and ended up creating art gallery space home, hosting so many art exhibitions 2008-2013 and welcoming servas guests, house swaps and then airbnb guests all over the world.  \r\n\r\nThen beautiful Sachi came into our life. \r\nA baby comes with changes, we have left beloved Millers Point and now living in Central Macdonald, 1,5hrs north west from Sydney where there are lots of cows and horses and the Hawksbury river just down the road. We purchased a little church on the hills there and dream to create a very special beautiful space where we can call it our home and also to host Airbnb guests. \r\n\r\nWe embrace changes in life therefore love traveling, we have been to many places. \r\n\r\nPeter is a video producer, running his own company after working for SBS Television as a promo producer for more than a decade. He makes beautiful videography ((URL HIDDEN) and currently leading TEDxSydney video team. I am an art therapist. I enjoy magical moments with kids who have lots of stories to tell. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to meeting you:):):)",

These are also my jobs.\r\n\r\nIve been a WWOOF host and traveler for many years (willing workers on organic farms). Even when my farm was just a balcony garden. \r\n\r\nI don't have a life motto exactly, but when thing go wrong, I ask myself 'Whiner or designer?', and that gets me positive and resourceful, finding a way to make things better.\r\nIf things go wrong for you I won't say it though.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "host_about": "My name is Fabio and I along with my friend and colleague Willian will ensure to provide you a wonderful stay in our apartments across London.\r\n\r\nWillian, Throughout his extensive travels, his unusual name \u2013 a derivative of William \u2013 has led to much curiosity. An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Hammond Street is a hidden away street in Dublin 8. Some of the locals call it Blackpitts, some call it Warrenmount - it's full of local lore. The street is quiet and settled and the house is part of row of terrace cottages that is classic to Dublin. Nearby are friendly neighbours, some of Dublin's most popular breakfast spots and caf\u00e9s, local pubs, an excellent market for organic food. Top sight-seeing destination St. Patrick's Cathedral is only steps away.  You'll be a 10-15-minute walk to town centre and temple bar and a 10-minute walk to lively Camden Street and its restaurants and live music venues (Whelan's). Grand Canal is very close for your morning run or for an afternoon picnic. If you're an antiques fan, head up to Francis Street to poke around on a Saturday afternoon. Blackpitts is charming, cozy and dynamic. It, along with The Liberties, The Tenters and The Coombe was part of the cIty's textile district and the neighbourhood is bursting with local history.

I'm interested in neighbourhoods with an urban feel, places located in spots with locally owned shops and caf\u00e9s - or beaches and parks. I'm Artistic Director and CEO of Dublin Fringe Festival - the city's largest interdisciplinary arts festival that sweeps across the city every September. It's amazing to get to know Dublin through its artists and happenings - the city's cultural calendar is always packed with great stuff.\r\n\r\nI travel often, and always try to add a bit of exploring a city to a work trip. I'm social and friendly and like to have my own space to retreat to - when I travel I can be home late from a show and up early for a meeting. I usually travel with a suitcase and a decent budget, I haven't backpacked in a long time.  I love to discover new things about a place - like to live like the locals. If you're ever in Dublin- would be happy to share some favourite spots!\r\n\r\nCan't live without: a great performing arts venue, festival and gallery, record collection, dinner and drinks with friends, good place for a drink, bike riding, a gym or place to go running, food of all kind. A bit of nightlife, gay or otherwise is a good thing too.\r\n\r\nFavourite destinations: Madrid, Melbourne, Reykjavik, Cape Breton, Kyoto, Tokyo, Ljubljana, Rio de Janeiro, Ghent and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nHope to meet you soon.\r\n\r\nKris",

I am still new on Artbnb, but I love how this helps me keep my studio apartment in Brooklyn. Though I travel so much, Brooklyn is home to me now, and keeping a nice cozy place that I can relax whenever I come back is so important. I appreciate the guests to take care of this place with appreciation; I would love to exhibit my care and appreciation to my guest as well.\r\n\r\nBeing at my current location, I go to BAM for movie and theater performance all the time. I recommend the guests to do at least one fun thing at BAM :)",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Downtown has had a resurgence in the last few years. The location is convenient to all the cultural gems that are there. It is close to Disney Hall, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Mark Taper Forum, the Ahmanson, the new Broad museum, MOCA, Grand Park, and the Colburn School. It is also walking distance to all courthouses downtown. If you want to go to LA Live or the convention center, it is about 20 minutes walking or 5 minutes if you take uber or have a car. Unlike lofts that have been converted, this condo was built for living purposes. It is in a SAFE and quiet part of downtown with lots of tourists walking around. It is also 15 minutes walking to Little Tokyo where there are so many great restaurants! It's about 15-20 minutes to Hollywood, 30 minutes to the beach, and has easy access to all major freeways.",

ZERO TOLERANCE for any kind of smoking (including vaping/e-cigs/hookah/marijuana etc). NO SMOKING ANYWHERE INDOORS OR OUTSIDE within the building premises including the pool area! If any evidence of smoking including a lingering smell is found, you will forfeit the entire security deposit. DO NOT SMOKE OUTSIDE ON MY BALCONY! It is against the rules. Go FAR away from my unit or the building if you plan on smoking. Smoking on my balcony bothers neighbors too. If they complain, your reservation will be cancelled with zero refund, you will forfeit the deposit, and you will be asked to leave. Better yet, reserve some other apartment that actually allows smoking if you cannot follow this rule. 2. SHOES",

    "transit": "The apartment is only a 2 minute walk from Camden Road overground station and 9 mins walk from Camden Town tube station. The tube station is serviced by the Northern line which will take you directly to Kings Cross station (great if you are travelling by train!), and other sights in London such as Leicester Square, the Houses of Parliament, and Waterloo station. There are also plenty of buses in the area, which are a great way of travelling if you like to have a peek at your surroundings as you travel. A great local tip is to download the Citymapper app. This free app will plan your journey for you efficiently and quickly. It gives you a variety of different transport options such as bike, rail, tube and Uber taxi. It will also take you step by step through your journey as you travel and notify you when you are nearing your destination.",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "host_about": "Hi there, I am George and proud to be AirBnB Superhost for the 10th time in a row! I love hosting people from all over the world. \r\nWhat I enjoyed most during my 18-month travel around the world a few years ago was to spend time with friends who were kind enough to host me in their homes (San Francisco, Tokyo, Miami, Rio de Janeiro just to name a few). Now that I have settled down in my favorite city Berlin, I love to return the  favor and open up my place to guests from other countries and cultures to make it their home away from home.\r\nI am a gay man, currently living by myself  with my adorable dog Luna, a German short hair pointer after my longtime Brazilian partner from Rio de Janeiro moved out to start a degree in 'Fashion Branding'  @ Amsterdam Fashion Institute (AmFI). I have always enjoyed hosting other people, showing them my city and sharing with them my view of Berlin, what to do and how to make the most of their time. \r\nProfessionally, I work as an business consultant for a big American company. As a balance for my creative half I like art (both visiting exhibitions as well as getting my own small eclectic collection), going for long walks with my dog in the country side around Berlin, architecture, traveling, enjoying the amazing cultural offers in Berlin ranging from opera to nights (and days) in my favorite club Berghain. But above all, I am  a huge fan of Franco-Belgian comics such as Tintin, Blake & Mortimer, Sopie & Starter etc. Not only do I collect these comics but I also collect art work such as Aroutcheff toys, cars and vehicles. \r\nThe other passion is decorating my apartement with rare antiques and art work. It makes me proud that virtually anyone who comes to visit immediately falls in love with my flat. \r\nMy favorite author is Haruki Murakami, about time he gets the Nobel prize for literature! Favorite destinations are Nepal, Japan and Easter Islands. \r\nIf I am not busy enjoying the cultural attractions of Berlin, I love watching well made US series e.g. Sopranos, The Wire and Game of Thrones. \r\nFavorite directors are Pedro Almodovar, David Lynch, Jim Jarmusch and Francois Truffeaut. \r\nIf you stay with me, you should not be afraid of dogs. I would like my guests to really feel at home at my place and invite them to the  entire space rather than just their room for cooking, relaxing, borrowing my books or taking a sun bath on one of my balconies. \r\nMy leitmotiv is \"Work hard & party hard\" and \"Live and let live\", I am tolerant towards other views and opinions as long as they do the same. I hate intolerant and hypocritical people who think they have eaten the truth with a spoon. Gay and lesbian friendly!",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "notes": "a few random reviews... Family Weekend Away Guest Traveling Fan (Omaha, NE )  Five adults stayed at Kevin and Michael's wonderful townhome in the Hollywood Hills.  We met Kevin upon arrival and I must say he was extremely accommodating (from the minute we contacted him regarding the rental to our visit).  The pictures reflect the townhome perfectly; however, the view from the window was better than shown! Our only recommendation is to be mindful of when events are being held at the Hollywood Bowl (as it is right around the corner and traffic can be heavy) and bring a smaller car so you can utilize the garage parking.  Parking on the street can be difficult. There is so much to do within walking distance!  And the neighbors are extremely nice and helpful!  The townhome was perfect for our extended weekend. We didn't use the kitchen other than the coffee maker, toaster and dishwasher, but there were coffee filters, paper towels and other items available for use (besides plenty of dishes,",
    "transit": "there is public transportation easily within walking distance.  Buses are just three blocks away, the metro just 5 blocks away, taxis arrive in 5 minutes and the freeway is just three minutes away by car, but completely invisible and unheard from the property.  There is a one car garage for your use during your stay.  Street parking has JUST turned permit, so we HIGHLY RECOMMEND a smaller vehicle to make use of the garage, and there are no street cleaning parking issues. (two temporary permits are available for you and your guests if needed, but there is a 100 fee per pass not returned).",

    "house_rules": "We have a three night minimum stay unless it is a last minute booking.  we expect our guests to be courteous to our neighbors and be aware that noise in the hollywood hills travels very easily and is amplified quickly.  after 11pm we request that all open windows and doors be closed if there are loud conversations, movies or music playing, and we request that we be notified if any groups of more than 8 people are present.  We require that at least one member of the guest party be at least 24 years of age, and we require names of guests and copies of ID for adults sent prior to arrival.  Smoking is NOT allowed inside, only in the courtyard or porch (with the door closed) and any evidence of smoking inside will be cause for immediate eviction from premises without refund, and/or forfeit of the damage deposit.  We OCCASIONALLY allow filming or small events, with an increased security deposit and full insurance certificate for filming, and a higher supplemental rate.  Pets are allowed ONLY",

The kitchen is yours for breakfast, and by arrangement at other times. You can even bring a guest, just pre-arrange.  Use thoughtful observation, and we will all be fine. Bonus points guest: be someone with a dream you are actively persuing.   Thats usually enough to guarantee loveable excellence.",

These are also my jobs.\r\n\r\nIve been a WWOOF host and traveler for many years (willing workers on organic farms). Even when my farm was just a balcony garden. \r\n\r\nI don't have a life motto exactly, but when thing go wrong, I ask myself 'Whiner or designer?', and that gets me positive and resourceful, finding a way to make things better.\r\nIf things go wrong for you I won't say it though.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

That said, Marylebone is certainly not snooty, in fact it has a very relaxed vibe. I love the great transport links at Baker Street and Marylebone Station which are only 5 mins away. There are also numerous buses that one can catch from Baker Street that will take you to all parts of town. Some of my favourite things to do in the area is to stroll down Marylebone High Street all the way to Bond Street. There are many lovely interior design stores and fashion stores. You can find brands such as J. Crew, Anthropologie, Whistles, Claudie Pierlot etc. on the High Street. Then there are loads of lovely cafes and restaurants scattered around the area. Here are some of the ones that I like: - Opso does small Greek tapas - Coco momo is a friendly modern pub - Trishna - 1 Michelin star Indian place focusing on seafood (yummmm",
    "notes": "My pictures are not the best so I am getting a professional photogragher but wanted to upload these pictures to make my listing live. I do not have a dishwasher I have a washing machine, but no dryer There is no cable but the TV has Netflix, Youtube, BBC iplayer and other options on the smart TV setting The flat overlooks the street so you will hear the hustle and bustle of London from time to time, especially if the windows are open If Checkin is between 9pm and 8am there is a \u00a340 fee",
    "transit": "The closest tube station is Marylebone but you might find it easier to go to Baker Street as there is a more choice there. It is on the Hammersmith & City, Metropolitan, Circle, Bakerloo and Jubilee lines. Thats basically covers most of London for you. If you want to go to Bond Street, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben etc. jump on the Jubilee line and you will be there in 10-15 mins. Going to Oxford Circus for shopping? No problem. Hop on to the Bakerloo line. For City works wanting to go to Moorgate, Farringdon or Liverpool Street you can take the Metropolitan or Hammersmith line.",

I am also an marathon runner so I took the opportunity during my trips to run in several cities (Hong-Kong, Dubai, Tokyo, Paris, Limerick, Rabat, NY, London and so many others..) \r\n\r\nAs I am often away from Paris for extended periods with my job, I decided to share my modern and secure apartment in Paris. \r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy the space while you stay here. I love to learn from others, so your feedback on ways to improve the living experience & comfort in my home is important to me!\r\n\r\nPlease send me any questions or queries you may have, e.g. tips on recommended local restaurants or places to visit. I will be happy to help you.\r\n\r\nTake a breathe now, Relax\u2026I am there to support you during your stay in Paris!\r\n\r\nIf I am around during your stay I hope we can a chance to have a drink in a French caf\u00e9 to share your experience.\r\n\r\nHope to see you in my cosy home.\r\n\r\n\u3088\u3046\u3053\u305d\u30d1\u30ea\u3078!\r\n\r\n\u30da\u30c9\u30ed\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30ab\u30ea\u30d6\u6d77\u306b\u3042\u308b\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u5cf6\u306e\u51fa\u8eab\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30d1\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u3067\u65c5\u884c\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4eba\u3068\u306e\u51fa\u4f1a\u3044\u3084\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u6587\u5316\u306b\u89e6\u308c\u305f\u308a\u5171\u6709\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002\r\n\r\n\u30dc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u6d3b\u52d5\u3067\u56fd\u5883\u306a\u304d\u533b\u5e2b\u56e3\u306b\u53c2\u52a0\u3057\u305f\u7d4c\u9a13\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\r\n\r\n\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u3084\u30ac\u30b8\u30a7\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5927\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3001\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u3082\u305d\u3093\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3067\u6ea2\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\r\n\r\n\u50d5\u306f\u8d70\u308b\u306e\u3082\u597d\u304d\u3067\u65c5\u884c\u5148\u3067\u306f\u5fc5\u305a\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3044\u307b\u3069\u8d70\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3044\u307e\u307e\u3067\u9999\u6e2f\u3001\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u3001\u6771\u4eac\u3001\u3071\u308a\u3001\u30e9\u30d0\u30c8\u3001\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\u3001\u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u306a\u3069\u3044\u308d\u3044\u308d\u306a\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u8d70\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\r\n\r\n\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u3067\u6d77\u5916\u3078\u306e\u51fa\u5f35\u304c\u591a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u50d5\u306e\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u3092\u8cb8\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\r\n\r\n\u305c\u3072\u3068\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3044\u6642\u9593\u3092\u904e\u3054\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\r\n\r\n\u5bbf\u6cca\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3063\u305f\u65b9\u306f\u305c\u3072\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u3053\u304b\u3089\u5b66\u3093\u3067\u3088\u308a\u904e\u3054\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044\u74b0\u5883\u4f5c\u308a\u306b\u5f79\u7acb\u3066\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\r\n\r\n\u4f55\u304b\u8cea\u554f\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3089\u6c17\u8efd\u306b\u805e\u3044\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\r\n\r\n\u3082\u3057\u79c1\u304c\u30d1\u30ea\u306b\u3044\u305f\u3089\u6848\u5185\u3082\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\r\n\r\n\u305c\u3072\u50d5\u306e\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u306b\u3044\u3089\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002",

I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!! Haha!",

Otherwise, we are about 10 - 15 minutes away from everywhere you need to go in the city! It's quite convenient!",

I have traveled to most major cities in the US, and very few out of the country. However, I am ready to see the world! My dream destination is Tokyo, Japan, amongst many others. \r\n\r\nI love hosting and meeting new people while sharing and learning about their experiences and lives. As a host, I share my space openly and create a fun and positive environment for my guests. Everyone feels at home, and most feel as if we've known each other for a lifetime. As a guest, I am respectful, clean, interactive, cheerful and always grateful!\r\n\r\nMy motto in life is, \"She who dares, wins!\"",

The house rules are simple: use common sense, lock the front door, clean-up after yourself, put dirty dishes in the dishwasher. Weekly, professional cleaning is provided. Street parking only. No parking, stopping or (un)loading on the shared driveway. Part of that land is owned by the Neighbors. When you park on the driveway the neighbors can't get to work and will call a tow-truck at your expense. Outside smoking only. Please respect other guests sensitivity to cigarette smell. This is a home where travelers from all over the world cross paths, respect each others privacy and once in awhile watch a sunset from the deck in good company. Enjoy an Airbnb host-guest experience in a safe, residential setting without the burden of responsibilities that come with being a roommate or tenant.  There is a lock on your door but I hope you don't feel the need to use it.",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "neighborhood_overview": "We are located in Downtown Los Angeles which is made up of around 15 different neighborhoods or districts, each with their own subtle character and personalities. We are in The Old Bank District which is a sub-district of sorts of The Historic Core, which contains some of the oldest buildings and architecture in the city. The neighborhood is a lively and fascinating place!  Downtown LA is very urban, and with that comes many wonderful and not so wonderful things. Some of the wonderful things are the museums\u2013like MOCA, The Broad, The Geffen Contemporary, and The Japanese American National Museum that are all within walking distance. There are numerous world class art galleries, restaurants, and coffee bars nearby. Downtown is really the only place in LA where you feel like you are in a city. Our neighborhood is incredibly diverse and colorful. It contains populations from just about every ethnic background, age range and economic strata. In recent years we\u2019ve had an abundance of amazing",
    "notes": "This is a REAL loft, not a shiny new apartment masquerading as a loft. While we have done a tremendous job making it somewhat luxurious and comfortable, there are some funky things to note.  This is a brick building with no insulation. The windows have thin glass and no screens. We find it lovely for fresh air and a nice breeze, but this means we get an occasional fly or mosquito buzzing about. It also gets city dusty real fast and as much as we try, its hard to keep up. The loft is warm in the summer and cool in the winter. The floors are gorgeous old barn wood that we installed ourselves and sometimes a board becomes loose or uneven, so be careful walking around with bare feet. The shower is a comedy of old tiles. We keep it very clean but its not the most glamorous shower in LA. The shower is located behind a folding partition, adjacent to the kitchen and living room\u2013mostly private, but not in an enclosed room with a lockable door way. We are acutely aware of this and make a point t",

Walking distance to METRO subway trains and our new METRO Bike Share, where you can conveniently rent European style city bikes and bounce around the downtown districts\u2013a great way to see the sights and enjoy our beautiful weather! There are trains and buses all around to take you to Hollywood or the west side. We are also a short ride from Union Station where trains can be caught to San Francisco, San Diego or anywhere else in the States. Uber and Lyft are abundant and the wait is usually never more than a few minutes. If you are driving be prepared to pay a premium for parking.

I also consider myself a citizen of the world, as I have traveled to 49 countries so far and in addition to English, speak some Japanese and French. \r\n\r\nIn my travels, I have stayed at some amazing places and know what a difference great hospitality can make to a trip. I therefore strive to create an experience at Bali Hai Castro that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back each time you return to San Francisco to stay here agin. \r\n\r\nI know the city and surrounding area very well and am always happy to give suggestions to make your stay exceptional. I am also a foodie and am working on a type of food blog \u2014 so if you are looking for great restaurants, I can share with you my favorites.\r\n\r\nAs a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it really affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.\r\n\r\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my puppy (Dexter), working out, hiking, traveling, skiing, and generally making the most of life. \r\n\r\nIf you are considering booking my home, I know you will love your stay here!\r\n\r\nIf I have made a reservation request with you, I can promise that you will be delighted to have me as a guest.\r\n\r\nHope to meet you soon,\r\n\r\nLaurence",

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

    "host_about": "My name is Fabio and I along with my friend and colleague Willian will ensure to provide you a wonderful stay in our apartments across London.\r\n\r\nWillian, Throughout his extensive travels, his unusual name \u2013 a derivative of William \u2013 has led to much curiosity. An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio",

I have met so many interesting people as a host and I look forward to those I will meet in the future.  \r\n\r\nI am a sports fan, reader, movie goer, and I like to try new things.  I play golf, basketball, and just about any sport you can think of.  I love ramen, yakiniku, yakitori, and shabu shabu here in Japan.   I love to try pizza all over the world when I travel.   \r\n\r\nRelationships are the most important thing for me in my personal life as well as business.  I like to go out and have a good time with my friends and meet new people.  \r\n\r\nI have learned so much from my over three years as an airbnb host and I am pleased to say I have most questions answered for you before you ask them, whether it be in the description of the listing or in the detail I supply you with at confirmation.  Still, I am always thinking of ways to make the guest experience more comfortable, efficient, and hassle free.   This is my goal as a host.  I will continue to get more places every month so I can host more travelers.  I want everyone to see Tokyo at least once!   \r\n\r\nTokyo is a great place to come and people from all over the world visit here making it a truly international city.  I love Tokyo and seeing the amazing sights and people.  It is a great place to explore and every day can be different.  This is an awesome destination for walkers and wanders filled with friendly people, tasty restaurants, and plenty of lights.   My tip is to make the initial contact with Japanese people because they are typically shy at first.   They will be happy to try to practice their English with you.\r\n\r\nHope I can host you soon!  May your trip to Tokyo be as amazing as my 7 years here has been!",
